# Exercise Tracker

This is an application designed to track a user's exercise. As I have been designing and programming my applications, I have been building them without considering their design or the patterns they should follow. Therefore, this serves as a follow-up to my [previous project](https://github.com/Memsworth/ConsoleApp.ShiftLogger). The goal of this repository is to learn how to implement the infamous 'Repository Pattern' and gain an understanding of design patterns, as well as build a frontend for the app using AngularJS.




## Requirements

- This is a two part project: A .NET WebApi and an FrontEnd app.
- The application focuses on recording, storing, and displaying exercise data
- Include a filter function to sort exercises based on a specific date.
- The database will have a single 'Records' table to avoid the complexities of relational data and allow us to focus on the design pattern and the frontend.
## Lessons Learned

- Building a Full-Stack App.
- Apply uniting testing to the app.
- Importance of unit tests when writing a large scale app.
